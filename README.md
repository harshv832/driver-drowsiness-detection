# Intallation process

## step 1:
 Install all libraries 
 - scipy (pip introduce scipy) 

- We'll require the SciPy bundle so we can figure the Euclidean distance between facial tourist spots focuses in the eye viewpoint proportion estimation (not stringently a prerequisite, but rather you ought to have SciPy introduced in the event that you mean on accomplishing any work in the PC vision, picture preparing, or AI space). 

- OpenCv 

- openCv for PC vision 

- numpy (pip introduce numpy) 

- numpy for fundamental preparing and calcutions ... 

- imutils (pip introduce imutils) 

- We'll likewise require the imutils bundle, my series of PC vision and picture preparing capacities to make working with OpenCV simpler. 

- pyglet (pip introduce pyglet) 

- we'll likewise require pyglet playing sound, for example, .mp3 , .wav ... 

- dlib 

- To identify and confine facial milestones we'll require the dlib library







# step 2
- Download the dlib's pre-prepared facial milestone locator. from hear "http://jmp.sh/4bIYiPU " place it place it same floder where alarm.wav contains 

- Note: without dlib's pre-prepared facial milestone locator document you can't run the code
# step 3
run .py file
